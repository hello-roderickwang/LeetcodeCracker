# Solving Technique

### Two-Pointer Technique

**Scenarios:**

1. Iterate the array from two ends to the middle;

   This technique is often used in a **sorted** array.

2. One slow-runner and one fast-runner at the same time.

   Sometimes might need to **sort** the array before using the two-pointer technique. And probably need a **greedy** thought to determine movement strategy for both pointers.
